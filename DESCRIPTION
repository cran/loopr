        Output

Description: Remedies a common problem in piping: not having access to
    intermediate outputs of the pipe. Within a "loop", a piping intermediate
    is  stored in a stack archive, data is processed, and then both the
    stored intermediate and the current output are reintegrated using an
    "ending" function. Two special ending functions are provided: amend and
    insert. However, any ending function can be specified, including merge
    functions, join functions, setNames(), etc. This framework allows the
    following work-flow: focus on a particular aspect or section of a
    data set, conduct specific operations, and then reintegrate changes into
    the whole.
